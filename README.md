# Metal-Engine-13
This is a engine made in Metal by KudeKube

Initial plans are 3D rendering with semi-advanced shading and gameloop systems.
Upgrades from Metal-Test-12 are as such:
- Much more robust rendering system.
- Enchancements in Input systems like event based input.
- Possibility for making actual gameloops.
- Possibly simple physics. Atleast hit testing.
- Audio playback.

- More features will be added as needed. These are just initial changes.
